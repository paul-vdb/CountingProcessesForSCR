Data available in this repo are all secondary:
* Fisher (*Pekania pennanti*) camera trap and genetic hair snag study used in Chapters 3 + 5 with known identity for the hair snag data and unknown in the camera trap data (Burgar et al. 2018).
* Cape Peninsula moss frog (*Arthroleptella lightfooti*) acoustic survey used in Chapters~3, 4 + 5 with known identity from ad-hoc methods (Setevnson et al. 2021).
* Tiger (*Panthera tigris*) camera trap study with known identities recorded in continuous time used in Chapter 6 (Dorazio and Karanth 2017). 
* Jaguar (*Panthera onca*) camera trap study with known identities recorded in continuous time used in Chapter 6 (Distiller et al. 2020).
